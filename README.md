# samba-ad-scripts | Domain Controller scripts

## 1. What is this?
This is a set of scripts written in Python to allow an easier management of **Samba-based** Active Directory Domain Controllers. The Samba package suite, on most distributions, is very complete and comprehensive, but its CLI-based interface does not allow batch operations on large user bases.

This scripts collection allows a user to manage the AD Domain using batch files of different types to perform basic operations on users, groups and shares.

## 2. Main Production Environment
The main production environment of these scripts is the **IIS Ferraris - Pancaldo** high school in **Northern Italy - Liguria - Savona**. It represents the largest Technical / Vocational High School in the Province of Savona, Liguria, housing more than 1500 students and more than 300 staff.

The production environment is running on a **Ubuntu Server-based** Linux installation, running Samba AD DC as Primary Domain Controller, with support for WPA2 Enterprise RADIUS authentication.
